This is the all-new, **Sanity Studio v3 exclusive version** of @sanity/document-internationalization released as v2.0.0

![v3 Studio with @sanity/document-internationalization v1 Installed](/img/sanity-document-internationalization-v2.png)

A complete rewrite of the original Document Internationalization plugin, exclusively for Sanity Studio v3. Major **benefits** from the previous versions include:

- Create new documents in any language and link translated references later
- Translation references are written to a separate "meta" document
- Updates to one translation no longer affect the change history of others
- Does not require custom - nor modify the built-in - [Document Actions](https://www.sanity.io/docs/document-actions)
- Changes made to one translation do not patch changes to other documents
- Configurable "language" field on documents
- Built-in static and parameterized initial value templates for new documents

## Upgrading

If this is your first time installing Document Internationalization, skip to the [Install](#install) section.

**I'm on Sanity Studio v3 and upgrading from plugin v1**

- You will need to perform a content migration to upgrade.
- See the [Content migrations](#content-migrations) section below.
- Your queries will also need to change, as translation references have moved. See the [Querying](#querying-with-groq) and [Querying with GraphQL](#querying-with-graphql) sections below. [GraphQL](#)

**I'm on Sanity Studio v3 but will stay with the older plugin for now**

- Please refer to the [v2 branch](https://github.com/sanity-io/document-internationalization/tree/studio-v2)
- Install from `v1.0.0` and above
- This version of the plugin will not be updated with new features

**I'm on Sanity Studio v2**

- Please refer to the [studio-v2 branch](https://github.com/sanity-io/document-internationalization/tree/studio-v2)
- Install from `v0.0.0` and above
- This version of the plugin will not be updated with new features
- You will not need to perform a content migration to move to Sanity Studio v3, if you install the v1 plugin.

## Install

```
npm install --save @sanity/document-internationalization@studio-v3-plugin-v2
```

or

```
yarn add @sanity/document-internationalization@studio-v3-plugin-v2
```

## Usage

Add it as a plugin in `sanity.config.ts` (or .js):

### Basic configuration

The only required configuration is the `supportedLanguages` array and the `schemaTypes` array.

```ts
// sanity.config.ts

import {createConfig} from 'sanity'
import {documentInternationalization} from '@sanity/document-internationalization'

export const createConfig({
  // ... all other config
  plugins: [
    // ... all other plugins
    documentInternationalization({
      supportedLanguages: [
        {id: 'es', title: 'Spanish'},
        {id: 'en', title: 'English'}
      ],
      schemaTypes: ['lesson'],
    })
  ]
})
```

### Advanced configuration

The plugin also supports asynchronously retrieving languages from the dataset, modifying the language field, adding a bulk publishing feature and adding additional fields to the metadata document.

```ts
// sanity.config.ts

import {createConfig} from 'sanity'
import {documentInternationalization} from '@sanity/document-internationalization'

export const createConfig({
  // ... all other config
  plugins: [
    // ... all other plugins
    documentInternationalization({
      // Required
      // Either: an array of supported languages...
      supportedLanguages: [
        {id: 'nb', title: 'Norwegian (BokmÃ¥l)'},
        {id: 'nn', title: 'Norwegian (Nynorsk)'},
        {id: 'en', title: 'English'}
      ],
      // ...or a function that takes the client and returns a promise of an array of supported languages
      // MUST return an "id" and "title" as strings
      // supportedLanguages: (client) => client.fetch(`*[_type == "language"]{id, title}`),

      // Required
      // Translations UI will only appear on these schema types
      schemaTypes: ['lesson'],

      // Optional
      // Customizes the name of the language field
      languageField: `language` // defauts to "language"

      // Optional
      // Adds UI for publishing all translations at once. Requires access to the Scheduling API
      // https://www.sanity.io/docs/scheduling-api
      bulkPublish: true // defaults to false

      // Optional
      // Adds additional fields to the metadata document
      metadataFields: [
        defineField({ name: 'slug', type: 'slug' })
      ],

      // Optional
      // Define API Version for all queries
      // https://www.sanity.io/docs/api-versioning
      apiVersion: '2021-03-25'
    })
  ]
})
```

### Language field

The schema types that use document internationalization must also have a `string` field type with the same name configured in the `languageField` setting. Unless you want content creators to be able to change the language of a document, you may hide this field since the plugin will handle writing patches to it.

```ts
// ./schema/lesson.ts

// ...all other settings
defineField({
  // should match 'languageField' plugin configuration setting, if customized
  name: 'language',
  type: 'string',
  readOnly: true,
  hidden: true,
})
```

## Importing plugin components

Some components and functions from the plugin are exported for you to use throughout the Studio.

### useDocumentInternationalizationContext

The `useDocumentInternationalizationContext` hook can be used to access all plugin configuration values, including the result of `supportedLanguages` if it is an async function.

```tsx
import {useDocumentInternationalizationContext} from '@sanity/document-internationalization'

export function MyComponent({doc}: {doc: SanityDocument}) {
  const {languageField} = useDocumentInternationalizationContext()

  return <Badge>{doc[languageField] ?? `No Language`}</Badge>
}
```

### DocumentInternationalizationMenu

The menu button shown at the top of documents can be imported anywhere and requires the published document ID of a document and its schema type to set the language of the document and handle creating new translations and the metadata document.

```tsx
import {DocumentInternationalizationMenu} from '@sanity/document-internationalization'

export function MyComponent({_id, _type}) {
  return (
    <DocumentInternationalizationMenu
      documentId={_id.replace(`drafts.`, ``)}
      schemaType={_type}
    />
  )
}
```

## Code examples

### Querying with GROQ

To query a single document and all its translations, we use the `references()` function in GROQ.

```json5
// All `lesson` documents of a single language
*[_type == "lesson" && language == $language]{
  // Just these fields
  title,
  slug,
  language,
  // Get the translations metadata
  // And resolve the `value` field in each array item
  "_translations": *[_type == "translation.metadata" && references(^._id)].translations[].value->{
    title,
    slug,
    language
  },
}
```

### Querying with GraphQL

Fortunately, the Sanity GraphQL API contains a similar filter for document references.

```graphql
# In this example we retrieve a lesson by its `slug.current` field value
query GetLesson($language: String!, $slug: String!) {
  allLesson(
    limit: 1
    where: {language: {eq: $language}, slug: {current: {eq: $slug}}}
  ) {
    _id
    title
    language
    slug {
      current
    }
  }
}

# And then can run this query to find translation metadata documents that use its ID
query GetTranslations($id: ID!) {
  allTranslationMetadata(where: {_: {references: $id}}) {
    translations {
      _key
      value {
        title
        slug {
          current
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Allowing the same slug on different language versions

Often your translated documents will share the same slug. You might wish to move this into the metadata document itself using the `metadataFields` option in the plugin. Alternatively, you can customize the `isUnique` function on a [slug type field](https://www.sanity.io/docs/slug-type#isUnique-**3dd89e75a768**).

```ts
// Add the isUnique option to your slug field
defineField({
  name: 'slug',
  type: 'slug',
  options: {
    isUnique: isUniqueOtherThanLanguage
  },
}),

// Create the function
// This checks that there are no other documents
// With this published or draft _id
// Or this schema type
// With the same slug and language
export async function isUniqueOtherThanLanguage(slug: string, context: SlugValidationContext) {
  const {document, getClient} = context
  if (!document?.language) {
    return true
  }
  const client = getClient({apiVersion: '2023-04-24'})
  const id = document._id.replace(/^drafts\./, '')
  const params = {
    draft: `drafts.${id}`,
    published: id,
    language: document.language,
    slug,
  }
  const query = `!defined(*[
    !(_id in [$draft, $published]) &&
    slug.current == $slug &&
    language == $language
  ][0]._id)`
  const result = await client.fetch(query, params)
  return result
}
```

## Deleting documents

### Deleting a single translated document

By default, this plugin creates a strong reference between a document and its connected translation metadata document. Because reference integrity is maintained by the API, you cannot delete a document that has a strong reference to it. To offset this difficulty, the plugin exports a document action that will allow you to remove the translation reference from the action, before proceeding to delete the document. It is not added by default to your schema types.

![delete translation document action](https://github.com/sanity-io/document-internationalization/assets/9684022/edccb456-f6e1-4782-9602-b279e9689357)

Import into your Studio's config file

```ts
import {
  documentInternationalization,
  DeleteTranslationAction,
} from '@sanity/document-internationalization'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...all other config
  document: {
    actions: (prev, {schemaType}) => {
      // Add to the same schema types you use for internationalization
      if (['page'].includes(schemaType)) {
        // You might also like to filter out the built-in "delete" action
        return [...prev, DeleteTranslationAction]
      }

      return prev
    },
  },
})
```

### Deleting all translations

The metadata document also contains a "Delete all translations" document action which is queued by default for only that schema type. It will delete all of the documents in the `translations` array of references, as well as the metadata document itself.

![delete all translations document action](https://github.com/sanity-io/document-internationalization/assets/9684022/fda956f1-26e7-430a-aeef-1db4166e9cd6)

## Note on document quotas

In previous versions of this plugin, translations were stored as an array of references on the actual documents. This required a base language, lead to messy transaction histories and made deleting documents difficult.

In this version of the plugin, translations of a document are stored as an array of references in a separate document of the type `translation.metadata`, and one is created for every document that has translations. A document with no translations will not have a metadata document.

This means if you have 100 documents and they are all translated into 3 languages, you will have 400 documents. Keep this in mind for extremely high-volume datasets.

## Content migrations

There are two scripts in the `./migrations` folder of this repository. They contain scripts that should help move your content over â however, they may require updating to match your current settings.

**These have not been thoroughly tested on all platforms. Please take a backup before proceeding. Test on a duplicate dataset.**

- `./migrations/renameField.ts` will update the language field on translated documents
- `./migrations/createMetadata.ts` will create metadata documents for the arrays of references and unset those fields from translated documents
